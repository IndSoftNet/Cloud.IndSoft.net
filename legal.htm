                        <h3>Resource Usage/Fair Usage Policy</h3>
                        <p>
                            Having high-limit or unlimited access to resources does not mean, that you can use your hosting in a such a way that it negatively affects the server operation, for illegal purposes or in any way that violates
                            applicable legislation.<br />
                            It is also acknowledged by users that these resources are limited by physical restraints of technology as well as by reasonable limits of a shared resource environment. Users must realize that server technology
                            limits the amount of available resources for use, including but not limited to disk drive space, CPU processing power, memory and access speed. It is furthermore acknowledged by users that all provided services
                            are of a shared-server nature, and other users are sharing the provided space. Customer accounts are placed on a server with up to hundreds of other users. Unlimited resource packages are designed to meet the
                            typical needs of small business and home business website. It is NOT intended to support the sustained demand of large enterprises, internationally based businesses, or non-typical applications better suited to a
                            dedicated server.<br />
                            Each customer is required to utilize as little server resources as possible, so as to allow for reasonable performance by all IndSoft Systems customers. Because server CPU and memory are shared resources,
                            excessive consumption of these resources can interfere with or completely prevent normal service performance for other users. IndSoft Systems at its sole discretion reserves the right to suspend or terminate
                            Services on any account that, is abusing server resources. Such suspension or termination can occur at any time without prior warning, and for any or no reason. Enforced resource limits for all hosting packages
