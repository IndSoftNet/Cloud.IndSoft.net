										<p>Access the password retrieval system through the Forgot your Password? link on the Control Panel log in page. The password retrieval system requires your account username, which is a seven digit number (e.g., 0012345). The username is in the welcome email you received when you opened the account.</p>
										<ol><li>Click the Forgot your Password? link.</li><li>Enter your account username into the "Username" field and click "Submit."</li><li>An email will be sent to the primary account contact. Click the link in the email (if you do not click the link within 24 hours, it will become invalid).</li><li>When you visit the link a new login page will appear. Enter your username.</li><li>A second email will be sent to the primary account contact containing a randomly generated password. Go back to the log in page and enter the new password.</li></ol>
										<p>The first time you log in to Control Panel with the randomly generated password you will be prompted to enter a new password. Entering a new password is optional. You may keep the randomly generated password if you choose to. You will only be prompted to change the password once.</p>
										<p>Note that if you repeat steps 1 and 2 at any time a new request will be generated and the first request will be invalidated.</p>
										<p>If you fail to receive the lost password messages, be sure to check your spam/junk/bulk email folder, as many spam filters will flag legitimate emails. If you are using spam filters, please whitelist the indsoft.com domain name.</p>
										<p><strong>If you do not know your account username</strong>, use the Forgot your Username? link on the Control Panel log in page. The username retrieval system requires your primary account email address. Note that you will receive login information for every account associated with the email address that you submit. If you enter an email address that is not associated with an account, you will not receive an email or an error message. We do not provide an "email address does not exist" error for security reasons.</p>
										<p><strong>If you do not have access to the primary email address for the account</strong>, we will require authentication of account information, typically the answer to the security question that you provided when the account was created. To insure customer privacy we cannot provide any account information without this authentication.</p>
										<p>To begin the authentication process, send an email to billing@indsoft.com or support@indsoft.com. Include your domain name, and the answer to your security question in your initial email for speedier resolution. We will reset the account password and send you an email with a randomly generated password. Once you have logged in you can update your primary email contact.</p>

										<p>Modifying the Whois (Contact Details) of Domain Names</p>
										<p>Typically, Domain Name Contacts are of the following types:</p>
										<p>Registrant Contact</p>
										<p>Administrative Contact</p>
										<p>Technical Contact</p>
										<p>Billing Contact<p>
										<p>In the system, Contacts are independent of a domain name. All contact information that you have used for registering any domain name, is maintained separately in a Contact database. This allows you to re-use the contact information for any other domain name registration without having to fill in all the values again. Think of this as linking Contacts from your Contact database to the domain names you register. Whenever you change any contact information in any Contact, it will automatically change that information in every domain name which uses that contact information and reflect the same immediately in the Whois lookup results of your domain name.</p>
										<p>Whenever you change the contact information of a Registrant Contact that is associated with a Domain Name the contact change has to be approved by both the losing and the gaining registrant. The changes can also be authorized by a Designated Agent</p>
										<p>What is Designated Agent (DA)</p>
										<p>The ICANN Transfer Policy allows the sponsoring registrar to serve as a Designated Agent (DA). The Designated Agent is specifically authorized by the Prior Registrant and New Registrant to make any change on its behalf, through consent that must be obtained from both individually at least once by the sponsoring registrar.</p>
										<p>When modifying the name and/or company and/or email address details of the registrant, the user will be provided two options:</p>
										<p>Registrant Authorization not required -- Appoint Registrar as Designated Agent:</p>
										<p>Registrar acts as Designated Agent and authorizes the change request. Under this option, the registrant cannot opt out of the 60-day lock. If both the Prior Registrant and New Registrant authorized the registrar to serve as DA, the change request will apply immediately. If only one has authorized the registrar to serve as DA, the change will only occur after the Prior Registrant or New Registrant, whichever is required, consents to the requested change.</p>
										<p>Registrant Authorization required -- Maintain Status Quo:</p>
										<p>As it currently is handled now, the Prior Registrant and New Registrant receive email messages asking to approve the change to the Registrant contact. Option to opt out of 60-day lock will be provided to the registrant.</p>

										<p>More and more organizations are moving from the shorter 384, 512 and 768-bit keys up to 1024 and higher in order to protect against spoofing because the smaller keys are easier to crack. Our DNS system intuitively supports a 2048-bit key and larger. Simply paste it into the TXT record and hit save. Our back-end systems do what’s needed to break it up into 255 byte chunks to comply with RFC 1035, section 2.3.4 so you don’t have to do anything.</p>

										<p>SSL/TLS are security protocols that allows the transmission of data to be encrypted. This allows users to access email through a third-party email client without the fear that someone has intercepted their data. SSL will encrypt the connection immediately upon connection. TLS will encrypt once the STARTTLS command is sent. TLS will need to be set up over port 25, 110, 143 and SSL over ports 465, 993, and 995.</p>
										<p><strong><u>NOTE:</u></strong> This article assumes you have obtained a copy of the certificate from your SSL provider and have installed it on your server within your certificate stores personal folder. If you have not done this, please do so prior to following the directions below.</p>
										<p>Prior to configuring SmarterMail to be secured over SSL or TLS, the SSL certificate installed on the server must first be exported to a PFX file that is password protected and contains the certificates private key information.</p>
										<p>Follow these steps to export your SSL certificate to a PFX certificate file:</p>
										<ol>
											<li>Open up Microsoft Management Console (MMC)</li>
											<li>CTRL + M to add new Snap In -&gt; Certificates -&gt; Select Local Computer</li>
											<li>Expand Personal</li>
											<li>Expand Certificates</li>
											<li>Right click the Desired Certificate, select All Tasks -&gt; Export</li>
											<li>In the new window that pops up Hit Next</li>
											<li>Select Yes, Export the Private Key and hit Next</li>
											<li>Enter in the desired password and hit next.</li>
											<li>Ensure Personal Information Exchange -PKCS #12 (PFX) is checked and also include all certificates in the certification path if possible and select next</li>
											<li>Enter in the path and name where you would like the certificate saved such as C:\SmarterMail\Certificates\mail.domain.com.pfx and click finish.</li>
										</ol>
										<p>Follow these steps to add a port to listen over SSL or TLS:</p>
										<ol>
											<li>Log in to SmarterMail as the system administrator.</li>
											<li>Click the <strong>Settings</strong> icon.</li>
											<li>Click <strong>Bindings</strong> in the navigation pan and click the <strong>Ports tab</strong>.</li>
											<li>Click <strong>New</strong> in the content pane.</li>
											<li>Complete the following required fields: Protocol, Encryption (SSL or TLS), Name, Port, Certificate Path and password. All other fields are optional.</li>
											<li>Select the IP Address for the port to listen on.</li>
											<li>Click <strong>Save</strong>.</li>
										</ol>
										<p><strong><u>NOTE:</u></strong> Using similar steps as above, modify your existing standard ports (25, 110, 143, etc) to be encrypted with SSL or TLS.</p>
										<p>It is possible to secure the SmarterMail ports for different domains/certificates as well. The ports can be secured in two ways, one requiring a Unified Communications Certificate (UCC) and one method requires a unique IP address for each domain.</p>
										<ul>
											<li>For UCC configurations, the certificate can be configured to secure a variety of hostnames within it's SAN field, for example mail.domainA.com, mail.domainB.com, mail.domainC.com, etc. This certificate can then be exported following the instructions above and configured within SmarterMail to secure multiple domains.</li>
											<li>If there are unique IP addresses assigned for each domain, each domain would need to have their own unique set of ports tied to the proper certificate and IP for the domain in question. For example, the administrator will need to create a set of port mappings for 25 (TLS), 110 (TLS), 143 (TLS), 465 (SSL), 993 (SSL), 995 (SSL), when creating these ports makes sure to add a description to indicate which domain these port mappings belong to and point these ports to the proper certificate location. Next these ports would need to be configured to listen on the IP Address assigned to the domain being configured. This process will need to be repeating for each Domain\IP that needs to be secured for the given domain.</li>

										<p>When an account has been compromised, the spammer will try to send as much spam as possible though the server. This can cause a number of issues, including getting a domain or IP address blacklisted. Accounts can get compromised a number of ways, the most common of which is when the account is using a weak, insecure password.</p>
										<p>There are a few ways administrators can become aware of when an account has been compromised, including by noticing the mail server spool filling up, causing both incoming and outgoing messages to be delayed. When this happens, administrators can review the Spool Dashboard or traffic reports in order to find the compromised domain and account being used to send the large amount of email.</p>
										<p>Follow these steps to find the compromised account by reviewing the Spool Dashboard:</p>
										<ol>
											<li>Log into SmarterMail as an Administrator.</li>
											<li>Within the <strong>Manage </strong>section, click on <strong>Spool</strong> in the navigation pane.</li>
											<li>In the <strong>Overview tab</strong>, look at the <strong>Top Outbound Senders</strong> section to find any anomalies in outbound deliveries. If an account has been compromised, it will likely be the first in the list with the most deliveries. (The spool dashboard updates every 20 seconds for a real-time look at the spool.)</li>
											<li>Determine whether the messages are valid emails or spam. This can be done in two ways. a.) Click on the Spool tab and use the search bar to find messages sent by the suspected user account. b.) Click on the <strong>Actions</strong> menu in the spool overview to <strong>Move Messages</strong> sent by the user (that are currently held in the spool) to their own folder on the server. Review the messages.</li>
											<li>If the messages are found to be spam, use the <strong>Delete Messages </strong>action to delete the remaining messages in the spool sent by that user.</li>
											<li>If the account is determined to be compromised, you can also temporarily disable the account, preventing future email from being sent out. Use the <strong>Disable User</strong> action to disable the user's account but still allow it to receive mail. Alternatively, you can navigate to the user's settings to change the User Status to 'Disable and don't allow mail'.</li>
											<li>Look at the <strong>Top Outbound IP Addresses</strong> section to find any anomalies in outbound deliveries. Spammers may send messages through just one user account; however, they may authenticate using various IP addresses.</li>
											<li>Repeat steps 5 and 6 to determine the legitimacy of the messages and take actions against them, if necessary.</li>
											<li>If an IP Address is in violation, use the <strong>Blacklist IP</strong> action to add the IP address to the STMP Blocked list. (The IP will be blocked on SMTP only.)</li>
										</ol>
										<p>Follow these steps to find the compromised account by reviewing reports:</p>
										<ol>
											<li>Login to SmarterMail as an Administrator.</li>
											<li>Click on the <strong>Reports icon.</strong></li>
											<li>Select <strong>Message Traffic </strong>and change the mode from Trend to Domains<strong>.</strong></li>
											<li>This report will list all domains on the server and display the number of incoming and outgoing messages for each. The domain with the compromised account will generally be the one with the most outgoing messages.</li>
											<li>Clicking on the domain will display the Message Traffic report for users on that domain. From here, make sure the report Mode is set to Users (not Trend), and you can narrow down the one (or more) users sending the largest amount of email.</li>
										</ol>
										<p>The next steps are generally up to the administrator. They can either Manage the domain and change the user's password, disable the user or delete the account entirely to stop the spammer from relaying though the server.</p>

										<p>In an ever changing digital landscape, personal and business owners of all sizes that are hosting data online must remain vigilant. There are a variety of ways in which a Hybrid or Dedicated Server may be taken offline. One of the most prevalent ways to bring a business offline is through the use of a DDoS attack. </p>
										<p>In 2017, a <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/8/18/16170536/mirai-ddos-playstation-network-dyn-internet-angry-gamers">DDoS attack</a> aimed at PlayStation servers brought down several major services, blocking user access to Netflix, Amazon, and others throughout the northeastern parts of the US.</p>
										<p>But what is a DDoS attack and how can server administrators and businesses prevent DDoS attacks from crippling their business? In this article, we&#39;ll provide you all the resources you need to understand what DDoS attacks are, how they can impact your business, and how to setup DDoS protection today.</p>
										<h5 class="mt-4">What Is a DDoS Attack?</h5>
										<p>Before we can understand how to prevent a DDoS attack, we must first understand what it is. DDoS stands for Distributed Denial of Service and it is a coordinated attack against one server or network in which dozens, hundreds, or even thousands of devices send fake traffic to one server in an attempt to bring the server or network offline. How this is actually accomplished varies depending on the DDoS attack type, which we will explore below.</p>
										<p>What a DDoS attack means for genuine website visitors is that when they attempt to navigate a website, the server will be so congested with traffic that they will typically see a server error page and will be unable to browse the site. This could mean that visitors are unable to purchase your products or services or manage their accounts, which can be very costly for businesses.</p>
										<p>DDoS attacks range in severity and length. They can be as little as a few gigabytes per second and up to several hundred gigabytes. The larger the DDoS attack, the more difficult it can be to stop it.</p>
										<h5 class="mt-4">Why Do DDoS Attacks Exist?</h5>
										<p>The vast majority of DDoS attacks are a targeted action against an organization. Hackers will reach out to an organization and demand a ransom payment to be paid (typically via bitcoin) or else the group will begin a DDoS attack against the company. This is often a bluff, but at times these groups will begin the attack as they claimed.</p>
										<p>Businesses would be ill advised to pay any ransom to these groups as they are likely to keep coming back for more if they have a victim who is willing to comply. If you receive a notice like this, take the opportunity to deploy DDoS protection on your servers to prevent any downtime that may arise on unprotected servers.</p>
										<h5 class="mt-4">What are the Impacts of a DDoS Attack?</h5>
										<p>To understand how critical DDoS protection is to your business, think about the impact of your website going down for hours or even days. How would that affect your sales? How many prospective clients would you lose?</p>
										<p>If a company generates, say, $5,000 in sales on an average day, one DDoS attack could cost the company over $15,000. That&#39;s a big hit for a small business. These attacks are also typically conducted during peak business hours, and attackers try to sustain the attacks as long as possible.</p>
										<p>DDoS attacks also affect your brand&#39;s reputation. Users won&#39;t know you&#39;re the victim of an attack. All they know is that they visited your site but couldn&#39;t get through because your servers were down.</p>
										<h5 class="mt-4">How Do DDoS Attacks Work?</h5>
										<p>The methods utilized in performing a DDos attack vary based on the type of attack. Here are the most common methods used to attack a server:</p>
										<h5 class="mt-4">SYN Flood</h5>
										<p>The victim server receives spoofed SYN requests with fake IP addresses. This attack overwhelms system resources as the server tries to interpret the incoming packets which are coming in at a high rate.</p>
										<h5 class="mt-4">SYN-ACK Flood</h5>
										<p>The victim server receives spoofed SYN-ACK packets at a high packet rate, resulting in depleted system resources as the server tries to respond to these packets.</p>
										<h5 class="mt-4">Fake Session</h5>
										<p>This attack fakes a complete TCP communication and is designed to fool new defense tools that only monitor incoming traffic to the network.</p>
										<p>DDoS attackers utilize one of a variety of attack types, or a combination, in an attempt to bring a server offline and bypass any DDoS protection that may be in place. That&#39;s why it&#39;s important to have a DDoS Protection plan which can guard against all attack types.</p>
										<h5 class="mt-4">How to Protect Against DDoS Attacks</h5>
										<p>As you can see, DDoS attacks are fairly common and have a significant impact on business. Luckily, there are a few ways to protect against DDoS attacks and stop a DDoS attack from ever occurring.</p>
										<h5 class="mt-4">DDoS Protected Hosting</h5>
										<p>The best way to stop a DDoS attack before it even begins is to equip every server in your fleet with DDoS protection. DDoS protected hosting utilizes a hardware device between your server and the internet and filters all traffic in order to prevent any type of DDoS attack from occurring.<p>
										<p>DDoS Protection utilizes devices designed by RioRey, a leader in DDoS mitigation appliances. DDoS attacks are typically detected and mitigated within 0 to 90 seconds. This allows legitimate traffic to continue to reach the server, even when a DDoS attack is ongoing.</p>
										<p>DDoS protected hosting is a small monthly fee in addition to the standard server rental and it ensures your server is protected from attack. This is more of a proactive approach rather than having to jump into defense mode after an attack has started.</p>
										<p>Our enterprise-grade DDoS protection service protects against the most common DDoS attack types, including:</p>
										<ul>
											<li>UDP Flood</li>
											<li>SYN Flood</li>
											<li>SYN-ACK Flood</li>
											<li>ICMP Flood</li>
											<li>DNS Reflection Flood</li>
											<li>Fake Sessions</li>
											<li>Synonymous IP</li>
											<li>Misused Application Attack</li>
										</ul>
										<p>If you&#39;re looking for the best way to prevent a DDoS attack, a dedicated DDoS protection device in place at all times is the most effective solution. Some businesses choose to implement hardware mitigation only once an attack has started, but the damage of the attack has often already occurred and it can be several hours before a hardware device can be in place.</p>
										<h5 class="mt-4">Maintaining Server Security Best Practices</h5>
										<p>Aside from investing in DDoS protected hosting, maintaining proper server security procedures is another way to limit the impacts of a DDoS attack. These include:</p>
										<ul>
											<li>Limiting access to internal systems from devices outside of the network</li>
											<li>Keeping systems up to date</li>
											<li>Maintaining proper password management strategies</li>
										</ul>

                                    	<p>Every server on the internet is constantly vulnerable to intrusion by nefarious users. It’s important that server administrators take action as soon as they setup a server to protect their server.</p>
										<p>In this tutorial, we will outline some common steps for securing a Linux server. Commands in this tutorial will be based on CentOS 7, but they can be applied to most Linux distributions</p>
										<h5 class="mt-4">Update System Packages</h5>
										<p>The best linux server security tip and key defense against attack is an up to date system that only contains packages actively being used by your applications.</p>
										<p>If there is a service running that you don’t need, this leaves you unnecessarily vulnerable.</p>
										<p>To update system packages and delete obsolete ones, run:</p>
										<pre><code>yum update</code></pre>
										<p>To upgrade to the next major version of a package, and delete obsolete packages run:</p>
										<pre><code>yum upgrade</code>
										<h5 class="mt-4">Configure Automatic Updates</h5>
										<p>If you have a system which uses common applications that aren’t easily broken by routine system updates, you may wish to consider setting up automatic updates to improve linux server security. This is a useful server security tip for systems that you don’t regularly connect to.</p>
										<p>To setup daily automatic updates, install yum-cron:</p>
										<pre><code>yum -y install yum-cron</code>
										<p>Configure the package according to your needs:</p>
										<pre><code>vi /etc/yum/yum-cron.conf</code></pre>
										<p>Start and enable the service on boot:</p>
										<pre><code>systemctl start yum-cron systemctl enable yum-cron</code>
										<p>This application will be added to your daily crontab to install updates automatically for you.</p>
										<h5 class="mt-4">Maintain An Active Firewall</h5>
										<p>Installing and maintaining a firewall is a great way to close up ports that don’t need to be open, further enhancing server security. We recommend iptables for this case.</p>
										<p>To install iptables:</p>
										<pre><code>yum install iptables-services</code></pre>
										<p>Set iptables to run on startup:</p>
										<pre><code>systemctl enable iptables</code>
										<p>IPTables is now ready to be used For example, you can block an external IP with the following command:</p>
										<pre><code>iptables -A INPUT -s 192.168.0.10 -j DROP</code></pre>
										<p>To save rules permanently use the following command:</p>
										<pre><code>service iptables save</code>
										<h5 class="mt-4">Disable Root Login over SSH</h5>
										<p>Disabling root login locks down a common source of brute-forcing. Attackers will now need to know a unique system user and password before gaining entry to your server.</p>
										<p>To disable root login, follow these steps:</p>
										<p>Add a user which will have SSH access and set the password:</p>
										<pre><code>useradd billjohnson passwd billjohnson</code></pre>
										<p>Add this user to have sudo access to run root commands:</p>
										<pre><code>visudo</code></pre>
										<p>Add the following line to this file and save it, replacing username with the user:</p>
										<pre><code>username ALL=(ALL) ALL</code></pre>
										<p>Open the following file in a text editor</p>
										<pre><code>vi /etc/ssh/sshd_config</code></pre>
										<p>Locate the following line:</p>
										<pre><code>#PermitRootLogin yes</code></pre>
										<p>Change it to the following:</p>
										<pre><code>PermitRootLogin no</code></pre>
										<p>Add the following line, then save and close the file:</p>
										<pre><code>AllowUsers username</code></pre>
										<p>Restart SSH:</p>
										<pre><code>service sshd restart</code></pre>
										<p>Root access is now disabled over SSH, providing additional server security from intrusion</p>
										<h5 class="mt-4">Set Secure Password Policies</h5>
										<p>Enforcing strict user password rules is a great way to ensure you are not vulnerable to system entry through the use of weak passwords.</p>
										<p>Update the following file to set stricter password controls:</p>
										<pre><code>vi /etc/security/pwquality.conf</code></pre>
										<h5 class="mt-4">Conclusion</h5>
										<p>There are hundreds of ways to secure a Linux server. We’ve outlined a few of the popular ones, but every application is specific. We provide complete server hardening and proactive monitoring to keep your server running at its best.</p>

                                    	<p>Every server connected to the public internet is vulnerable to intrusion. It’s important to implement basic security procedures when you first setup a Windows Server to ensure it is secure from attack.</p>
										<p>This article will outline some key ways to secure your Windows Server.</p>
										<h5 class="mt-4">Download All Available Updates</h5>
										<p>Most servers are installed with an image of Windows Server that may not have all of the latest security and performance updates installed As soon as you receive the credentials for your Windows Server, make sure to login and install all available updates.</p>
										<h5 class="mt-4">Set Firewall Rules</h5>
										<p>Locking down open ports is an easy way to prevent unauthorized access to a server. Consider removing as many firewall rules as possible which will close all of the ports you are not using for your applications.</p>
										<p>You’ll want to ensure that common ports like 3389 for remote desktop access and port 80 for web traffic are open as needed so that your applications can continue to run as expected.</p>
										<h5 class="mt-4">Set Strong Password Policies</h5>
										<p>If many users are connecting to your Windows Server, especially novice users, consider enforcing a strong password policy. We recommend having a minimum password length and complexity as well as a password expiration policy.</p>
										<p>You will also want to only provide users with the admin access level required for their access to the server. Having multiple people with admin privileges who don’t need it is a recipe for disaster.</p>
										<p>The most common form of server intrusion is through weak passwords, so it’s important that every user has a strong password set with the correct user privileges.</p>
										<h5 class="mt-4">Disable File Sharing</h5>
										<p>Windows Server file sharing has historically been a point of compromise for many servers due to the ports that must remain open for this purpose. Unless absolutely required, we recommend disabling file sharing.</p>
										<h5 class="mt-4">Backup Your Server</h5>
										<p>The best way to truly secure a server is understanding that no technology is perfect, and even with the best implemented security policies, things happen. Maintaining routine full server backups gives you the peace of mind knowing that you can easily restore the data when you need it. Equally as important to performing backups is testing to ensure the restoration of backups works perfectly and is a known process. There is nothing worse than realizing the only backup of a server has been corrupt all along.</p>
										<h5 class="mt-4">Conclusion</h5>
										<p>There are many ways to secure a Windows Server. We’ve outlined some of the most important aspects, but there are so many other things you should consider.</p>
